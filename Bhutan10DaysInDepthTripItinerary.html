After a few days' journey, Bhutanese happiness seems to be getting closer and closer to us. Today, we are going to feel that happiness is neither far away nor unreachable, nor is it a godsend that can be obtained at will! Depart for the most sacred in Bhutan【Tiger's Cave Temple】Known as one of the top ten temples in the world, it is a holy place for Padmasambhava. It is built on the cliffs of the canyon over 900 meters. You need to walk for more than 2 hours to go up the mountain. People who are not used to sports usually find it a bit difficult; But as long as your heart returns to the present, you will find that the road to happiness may be a bit like climbing a tiger's cave temple! I hope you not only enjoy the beautiful scenery, but also get the wonderful experience when you reach the top! After going down the mountain, head to one of the oldest and most beautiful temples in Bhutan——【Chichu Temple】Visit, this temple was ordered by the Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo in 659 to build. The great Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche once presided over this temple. The eight-year-old Sakyamuni is enshrined in the temple as one of the most sacred Buddha statues in Bhutan. First, it was built in the same era as the Potala Palace in Tibet and is equally outstanding.
